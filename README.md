# hacking

```
  Usage:
    $ pnpm start
      This will (turbo) build && run the bot.

    OR
    $ cd apps/arb-jupiter-bot && yarn|npm|pnpm start
      This will run the bot.

      For now it will only run ping-pong strategy for testing purposes.
      You can play with the setup.ts in the apps/arb-jupiter-bot directory.
